#  Automated Hyperparameter Tuning for Classification with Ray Tune and XGBoost

## Overview

This is a simple code designed to simplify hyperparameter tuning for classification tasks using Ray Tune and XGBoost. Ray Tune accelerates the hyperparameter search process by leveraging distributed and parallel computing, enabling efficient management of resources and running multiple experiments concurrently. This significantly reduces the time required for tuning and allows for exploration of large hyperparameter spaces, which is especially beneficial for complex classification problems. XGBoost, a highly efficient and scalable gradient boosting algorithm, is known for its strong performance in classification tasks, offering high accuracy and fast computation. By combining Ray Tune's parallelism and XGBoost's classification prowess, this will streamlines the process of optimizing machine learning models, making it easier to find the best hyperparameters and achieve superior classification results.
